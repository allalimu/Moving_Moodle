\section*{Operation Steps Analysis}

Generally, there are 3 steps to move a system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Environment Setup.
    \item Moving all system related files, including Code and DB.
    \item Adjustments to the new Environment.
\end{enumerate}
Before implementing the 2nd step, make sure to put the moodle into maintenance mode; which is only disabled in the new server after the 3rd step is completed.

\subsection*{Environment Setup}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Server Base Packages.
    \\Moodle documentation will suffice for all needed packages.
    \item Apache Installation.
    \\Choosing apache service based on the version in server.
    \item Apache Configurations.
    \\Extracting Configuration from the old server to implement them in the new server.
    \item Mysql Installation.
    \\Version compatibility is important. 
    \item Mysql Configurations.
    \\Username and password, along with the right permissions.
    \item php Installation.
    \item php configurations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Moving Code and DB}
First, Extract DB using sqldump.
Then, using scp command, move all files, folders and extracted SQL files between the servers.
Last, install the DB.

\subsection*{new Environment Adjustments}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change Folders' Ownership and permissions.
    \item Run Crontab jobs for Moodle in the new server.
\end{enumerate}
