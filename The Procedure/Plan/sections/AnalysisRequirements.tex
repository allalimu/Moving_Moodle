\section*{Configurations Extraction Process}

There are 3 systems in Environment that needs to be checked and get its Configurations extracted in order for the moodle to run smoothly:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apache Configurations.
    \item Mysql Configurations.
    \item php Configuration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Apache Configurations Extraction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Apache Version.
    \item Apache Actual Configurations for portal.limu.edu.ly .
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{MYSQL Configurations Extraction}

The following is the only thing needed, and the rest can be executed as in the moodle documentation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item MYSQL version.
\end{itemize}

Can be easily extracted using the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ mysql -V
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection*{php Configurations Extraction}

In php, two pieces of information are needed to make an, almost, exact replica:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item php Version.
    \item php configurations file location.
\end{enumerate}

Both can be found in phpinfo inside the moodle administration panel.
